At first, I&#039;m excited because it accommodates FAANG curriculum. What do I get ? It&#039;s crap. This is like watching movies made by teenagers. It feels so amateurish, they cut shitload of content and use other people&#039;s youtube videos. Tables and Form ? It&#039;s not important though, we&#039;ll skip &#039;em. At this point, I realize that it&#039;s better to just pirate e-books, skim through the content for 1-2 minutes and drop the book if it&#039;s crap. If it&#039;s good, continue reading from page 1 to the end.<br><br>tl;dr:<br>Odinproject is bad, it&#039;s like watching 5 minutes movie based on award-winning 800 pages novel",
